class Roundtrip:
    """The immutable position round-trip.

    Parameters
    ----------
    entry : Execution
        The entry order execution.
    exit : Execution
        The exit order execution.
    quantity : float
        The total unsigned quantity of the position.
    side : RoundtripSide
        The side of the round-trip.
    entry_time : datetime
        The date and time the position was opened.
    entry_price : float
        The (average) price at which the position was opened.
    exit_time : datetime
        The date and time the position was closed.
    exit_price : float
        The (average) price at which the position was closed.
    duration : timedelta
        The duration of the round-trip.
    highest_price : float
        The highest price of the instrument during the round-trip.
    lowest_price : float
        The lowest price of the instrument during the round-trip.
    commission : float
        The total commission paid for the round-trip.
    gross_pnl : float
        The gross Profit and Loss of the round-trip.
    net_pnl : float
        The net Profit and Loss of the round-trip.
    maximum_adverse_price : float
        The maximum adverse price during the round-trip.
    maximum_favorable_price : float
        The maximum favorable price during the round-trip.
    maximum_adverse_excursion : float
        The percentage of the Maximum Adverse Excursion (MAE)
        which measures the maximum potential loss per unit of
        quantity taken during the round-trip period.

        This statistical concept originally created by John Sweeney
        to measure the distinctive characteristics of profitable trades,
        can be used as part of an analytical process to distinguish
        between average trades and those that offer substantially greater
        profit potential.

        0% is the perfect MAE, 100% and higher is the worst possible MAE.
    maximum_favorable_excursion : float
        The percentage of the Maximum Favorable Excursion (MFE)
        which measures the peak potential profit per unit of
        quantity taken during the round-trip period.

        This statistical concept originally created by John Sweeney
        to measure the distinctive characteristics of profitable trades,
        can be used as part of an analytical process to distinguish
        between average trades and those that offer substantially greater
        profit potential.

        0% is the perfect MFE, 100% and higher is the worst possible MFE.
    entry_efficiency : float
        The Entry Efficiency which measures the percentage in range [0. 100]
        of the total round-trip potential taken by a round-trip given its
        entry and assuming the best possible exit during the round-trip period.

        It shows how close the entry price was to the best possible entry
        price during the round-trip.

        100% is the perfect efficiency, 0% is the worst possible efficiency.
    exit_efficiency : float
        The Exit Efficiency which measures the percentage in range [0. 100]
        the total round-trip potential taken by a round-trip given its exit
        and assuming the best possible entry during the round-trip period.

        It shows how close the exit price was to the best possible exit price
        during the round-trip.

        100% is the perfect efficiency, 0% is the worst possible efficiency.
    total_efficiency : float
        The Total Efficiency which measures the percentage in range [0. 100]
        of the total round-trip potential taken by a round-trip during the
        round-trip period.

        It shows how close the entry and exit prices were to the best possible
        entry and exit prices during the round-trip, or the ability to capture
        the maximum profit potential during the round-trip period.

        100% is the perfect efficiency, 0% is the worst possible efficiency.
